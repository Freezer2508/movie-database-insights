# Movie Database Project

## About This Project
This is my first SQL project. I created a small movie database to practice working with SQL databases. The database includes movies, genres, actors, directors, and ratings. I also wrote some queries to analyze the data.

## Project Files
- `schema.sql` → Creates the tables.
- `data.sql` → Inserts sample data.
- `queries.sql` → Contains some basic SQL queries to explore the data.

## How to Use
### 1. Set Up the Database
1. Open phpMyAdmin or any SQL database tool.
2. Create a database called `movie_db`.
3. Import `schema.sql` (this creates the tables).
4. Import `data.sql` (this adds sample data).

### 2. Run Queries
- Open phpMyAdmin.
- Click on the SQL tab.
- Copy and paste queries from `queries.sql` to analyze the data.

This project was a learning exercise for me, and I'm happy with how it turned out!
